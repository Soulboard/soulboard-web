# AdNet Protocol

AdNet Protocol is a decentralized, IoT-enabled Web3 advertising platform bridging Advertising Companies (AC) and Ad Service Providers (ASP), leveraging blockchain technology and verifiable ad analytics.

## Overview

The platform provides IoT-based **Proof-of-View (PoV)** via ESP32-CAM modules and **Proof-of-Tap (PoT)** via NFC-enabled (PN532) IoT devices. It ensures transparent, accountable, and performance-based distribution of advertising funds (ADC tokens) using **Metal APIs**, secure identity verification via **Self Protocol**, and real-time blockchain event handling via **Nodit** integrations.

## Key Features

- **ASP & AC Portals:** Separate web dashboards with seamless wallet management via Privy and Metal API.
- **IoT Modules (ESP32-CAM & PN532 NFC):** Real-time ad analytics capturing viewer impressions (PoV) and direct user engagements (PoT).
- **Automated Token Distribution:** Nodit Webhooks trigger automatic payouts through Metal API, ensuring timely and accurate payments based on verified metrics.
- **Privacy-Preserving Verification:** Self Protocol enables zero-knowledge identity verification, ensuring regulatory compliance without compromising user privacy.

## Technologies Integrated

- **Metal:** Dynamic wallet creation, token management, automated reward distribution.
- **Self Protocol:** Regulatory-compliant, zero-knowledge-based identity verification.
- **Nodit:** Real-time frontend updates via blockchain event webhooks and automated backend payment triggers.
- **Privy Wallet:** Smooth user onboarding, wallet management, and secure transactions.

## Objective

AdNet Protocol optimizes ad spend, increases transparency, reduces fraud, and enhances consumer engagementâ€”transforming traditional advertising through verifiable, blockchain-based interactions.
